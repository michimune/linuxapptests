# Database Initialization Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'psycopg2'
**Problem**: The Python database setup script failed because the required `psycopg2-binary` package was not installed.

**Solution**: Added automatic Python package installation before running the database setup script.

#### Implementation Details:
- Added `InstallPythonPackages()` method that installs dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- Fallback mechanism to install `psycopg2-binary` directly if `requirements.txt` is not found
- Comprehensive error handling and logging for package installation process
- Non-blocking errors - if package installation fails, the program continues but logs warnings

#### Code Changes:
```csharp
private static async Task InstallPythonPackages(string requirementsPath, string workingDirectory)
{
    // Install from requirements.txt if available, otherwise install psycopg2-binary directly
    // Includes comprehensive error handling and output logging
}
```

### 2. Program Continues After Step A Failure
**Problem**: If Step A (Azure resource creation) failed, the program would continue trying to execute subsequent steps, which would inevitably fail since no resources were created.

**Solution**: Modified `RunTestMethod()` to wrap Step A in a separate try-catch block and exit early if it fails.

#### Implementation Details:
- Step A is now wrapped in its own try-catch block within `RunTestMethod()`
- If Step A fails, the program displays an error message and returns early
- Prevents unnecessary execution of subsequent steps when Azure resources aren't available
- Clear error messaging to indicate why the test sequence is being terminated

#### Code Changes:
```csharp
try
{
    await StepA_CreateWebAppAndPostgreSQL();
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Red;
    Console.WriteLine($"✗ Step A failed: {ex.Message}");
    Console.WriteLine("✗ Cannot continue with test sequence - exiting program");
    Console.ResetColor();
    return; // Exit early if Step A fails
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### Prerequisites Verification:
1. ✅ Python 3.11.9 is available in the system
2. ✅ Project builds successfully without warnings
3. ✅ All Azure SDK dependencies are properly configured

### Test Scenarios:
1. **Happy Path**: Complete test sequence with successful database initialization
2. **Missing Requirements**: Test behavior when `requirements.txt` is not found
3. **Python Package Failure**: Test behavior when package installation fails
4. **Step A Failure**: Verify early exit when Azure resource creation fails

### Error Handling:
- Non-blocking package installation errors
- Clear error messages with color-coded output
- Graceful degradation when optional components fail
- Early termination to prevent cascade failures

## Files Modified:
- `Program.cs`: Added `InstallPythonPackages()` method and modified `RunTestMethod()`

## Dependencies:
- Python 3.x with pip available in system PATH
- `psycopg2-binary` package (automatically installed)
- Requirements from `D:\repos\VibeCoding\SampleMarketingApp\requirements.txt`:
  - Flask==2.3.3
  - psycopg2-binary==2.9.7
  - python-dotenv==1.0.0
  - SQLAlchemy==2.0.21
  - Flask-SQLAlchemy==3.0.5
  - Werkzeug==2.3.7

## Next Steps:
1. Run end-to-end test to verify complete functionality
2. Validate database connectivity after initialization
3. Confirm application deployment and functionality
